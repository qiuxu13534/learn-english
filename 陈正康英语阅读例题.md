### P2-1 1.1 (1994)
One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the "cashless society" is not on the horizon -- it's already here.

55.	According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to ________.  
[A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes  
[B] obtain more convenient services than other people do  
[C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper  
[D] cash money wherever he wishes to

56.	From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that ________.  
[A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards  
[B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today  
[C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash  
[D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before
