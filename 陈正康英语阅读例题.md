### P2-1 1.1 (1994)
One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the country, and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For many of us the "cashless society" is not on the horizon -- it's already here.

55\.	According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to ________.  
[A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes  
[B] obtain more convenient services than other people do  
[C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper  
[D] cash money wherever he wishes to

56\.	From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that ________.  
[A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards  
[B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today  
[C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash  
[D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before

### P2-2 1.2
What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America -- breakthroughs such as the telegraph, the steamboat and the weaving machine?
Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country's excellent elementary schools: a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums to inventors; and above all the American genius for nonverbal, "spatial" thinking about things technological.

63\.	According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions in early America was in a large part due to ________.

[B] enthusiastic workers

Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing. The commercial TV channels -- ITV and Channel 4 -- were required by the Thatcher Government's Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for advertisers, and cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels -- funded partly by advertising and partly by viewers' subscriptions -- which will bring about the biggest changes in the long term.

58\.	The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no other than ________.  
[A] the emergence of commercial TV channels  
[B] the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government

Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built the Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was fascinated with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the "great game" of espionage -- spying as a "profession."" These days the Net, which has already re-made such everyday pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping Donovan's vocation as well.

### P2-3 1.5
While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression. "Those things that do not show up in the test scores -- personality, ability, courage or humanity -- are completely ignored," says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's education committee. "Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop out and run wild." Last year Japan experienced 2,125 incidents of school violence, including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, many conservative leaders are seeking a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal reforms introduced by the American occupation authorities after World War II had weakened the "Japanese morality of respect for parents."

65\.	Which of the following is true according to the author?  
[A] Japanese education is praised for helping the young climb the social ladder.  
[B] Japanese education is characterized by mechanical learning as well as creativity.  
[C] More stress should be placed on the cultivation of creativity.  
[D] Dropping out leads to frustration against test taking.
